# API Key and Secret Management Rules

- Never hardcode API keys or secrets in source code or files tracked by Git.
- Store secrets in configuration files (e.g., `Config.xcconfig`, `Secrets.plist`) that are listed in `.gitignore` and not committed to the repository.
- For Xcode projects, use `.xcconfig` files for secrets and add them to `.gitignore`.
- If using `.plist` or `.json` files for secrets, ensure these files are excluded from Git and referenced securely at runtime.
- For GitHub Actions or CI/CD, store secrets in GitHub Secrets and reference them via environment variables.
- Use the iOS Keychain for storing secrets at runtime; never persist them in plaintext files on device.
- Optionally, retrieve sensitive keys from a secure server at runtime and store only in Keychain.
- Add all secret-containing files (e.g., `Config.xcconfig`, `Secrets.plist`, `api_keys.json`) to both `.gitignore` and `.cursorignore`.
- Regularly audit the repository for accidental secret commits and rotate any exposed keys immediately.
